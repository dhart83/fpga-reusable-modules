# FPGA Reusable Modules

## Overview

Welcome to the `fpga-reusable-modules` repository! This repository is a collection of reusable FPGA modules designed to streamline the development process for FPGA projects. Whether you're a professional FPGA developer or an enthusiast, these modules provide a solid foundation for various digital design tasks, allowing you to focus on the unique aspects of your projects.

## Included Modules

This repository contains a variety of FPGA modules that can be reused across different projects. The modules cover a range of functionality, including communication interfaces (e.g., UART, I2C, SPI), clock management (e.g., clock dividers), and other commonly needed digital components.

Each module is self-contained and can be easily integrated into your FPGA designs. Detailed information about each module, including usage instructions, port descriptions, and example code, can be found in the individual `README.md` files located within each module's directory.

## Supported FPGA Platforms

The VHDL code provided in this repository is designed to be vendor-agnostic and should work across most FPGA platforms, including but not limited to:

- **Xilinx** (e.g., Artix-7, Spartan-6)
- **Intel** (formerly Altera)
- **Lattice Semiconductor**
- **Microsemi** (formerly Actel)

### About Constraints Files

While the VHDL modules are platform-independent, some modules may include constraints files (e.g., `.xdc` for Xilinx). These constraints files are specific to the Basys3 board, but they can be adapted for other FPGA platforms as needed. If you are using a different FPGA board, please create or modify the constraints file to suit your specific hardware setup.

## Installation and Usage

To integrate these modules into your FPGA project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dhart83/fpga-reusable-modules.git
   ```

2. **Add the Required Module(s) to Your Project:**

   Navigate to the directory containing the desired module and copy the source files (`.vhdl`, `.vhd`, etc.) to your projectâ€™s source directory. Alternatively, you can include the module as a Git submodule:

   ```bash
   git submodule add https://github.com/dhart83/fpga-reusable-modules.git path/to/your_project/module_name
   ```

3. **Include and Instantiate the Module:**

   In your top-level design file, include the module and instantiate it with the appropriate port connections.

4. **Configure Constraints:**

   If using a module with a provided .xdc file (for Basys3), include it in your project to correctly map the signals to your FPGA's I/O pins. For other boards, you'll need to create or adapt a constraints file.
